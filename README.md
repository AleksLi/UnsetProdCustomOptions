###Magento module

####*Module to Unset Custom Options for Product*

<p>I made this module in couple hours, so I think it's not the best decision.
But if you need to delete all custom options quickly you can implement this module
to your project. It helps me when I need this.</p>

**<p>But at first make a backup of your current database condition
 in case you don't like what you get after all </p>**
 
*I hope you will enjoy my work*
